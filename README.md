# Project description

    This project is a Blog where users can post stuff they find on internet and other users can comment the posts. It's made in Vue Js using HTML5 for web structure, Vuetify and inline CSS for styling, Axios and Wordpress REST API to handle the BackEnd portion and FIGMA for the design.

# Project briefing

    YOWL is a web application that will allow users to comment on all of the content found on the Internet. Each comment will be shared by the entire YOWL user community.

    Our tool will make it possible to decentralize comments from social networks and to have a new vision of the web through participatory on sources (OSINT) or simply by adding a comment thus federating communities around websites.

    YOWL is free, YOWL is accessible from the age of 13, YOWL wants to conquer the target 13 35 years old.
    We are going to develop the uses but also the application technically and its interface. You, students of Epitech, will have to present us, in few weeks, an interactive interface by explaining us each element created.
